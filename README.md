PingBot is a shitposter in bot form.
For each message sent it has a one in 100 (configurable) chance of pinging everyone
And if your message is "O O F" it moves you to a voice channel, plays the roblox oof, moves your back to where you were before and leaves the voice channel
And also it adds random reactions to random messages.
To set up the bot, run npm i and fill out .env with the appropriate values.
